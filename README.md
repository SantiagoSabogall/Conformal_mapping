# Conformal Mapping

This repository contains Python code to perform **conformal mappings** of regions in the complex plane.  
Conformal mappings are mathematical transformations that preserve **angles** and **local structure** of figures, and are widely used in **complex analysis**, **fluid dynamics**, and **electromagnetism**.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

This project was created as a learning exercise in complex function theory and visualization using Python.  
It aims to provide simple code to explore the geometric behavior of analytic functions.
